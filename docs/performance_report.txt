Concurrency and Performance Analysis Report
===========================================

Testing Methodology:
-------------------
- Unit tests verify correctness of cache operations, eviction policy behavior, and edge cases.
- Concurrency tests simulate multiple threads performing simultaneous get and put operations.
- Threads execute a mix of cache hits and misses to stress synchronization and consistency.
- Tests check for data races, consistency errors, and deadlocks.

Performance Benchmarking:
-------------------------
- Benchmarks implemented using Python `time.perf_counter()` to measure elapsed time.
- Workloads include:
  - Read-heavy: majority of operations are cache hits.
  - Write-heavy: frequent insertions and evictions.
  - Mixed read/write workloads.
- Benchmarks compare eviction policies: LRU vs. LFU.
- Measured metrics:
  - Throughput (operations per second)
  - Average latency per operation (milliseconds)
- Benchmarks executed with multiple threads to evaluate concurrency scalability.

Results Summary:
----------------
- LRU policy generally outperforms LFU in throughput due to simpler data structures and lower overhead.
- LFU provides better eviction quality in workloads with skewed access patterns but suffers from higher latency.
- Throughput decreases as thread count increases, due to lock contention on the global cache lock.
- Read-heavy workloads scale better than write-heavy due to fewer eviction events.
- Concurrency tests show no data corruption or crashes, indicating correctness under load.

Bottlenecks and Limitations:
----------------------------
- Global lock in ThreadSafeCache causes contention under high concurrency.
- LFU eviction overhead can degrade performance in write-heavy scenarios.
- Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) may limit true parallelism in CPU-bound parts.
- Data structures can be optimized (e.g., using lock-free or segmented approaches) for better scalability.

Recommendations and Future Work:
--------------------------------
- Implement finer-grained locking or lock striping to reduce contention.
- Explore asynchronous or lock-free data structures.
- Add additional eviction policies like FIFO or ARC.
- Profile memory usage and optimize data structures for space efficiency.
- Extend benchmarking to real-world workloads and longer durations.

Conclusion:
-----------
The implemented cache provides a robust thread-safe design with pluggable eviction policies. Benchmarking reveals expected trade-offs between eviction quality and performance. The project offers a strong foundation for concurrent cache systems with clear directions for improvement.
